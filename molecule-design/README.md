# Molecular Design Application

This application is an initial version of the electrolyte design application
being built as a collaboration between JCESR and ExaLearn. 
Our goal is to be as close to the final application as possible 
without making installation on different HPC systems burdensome.

## Installation

The additional packages needed by this application are defined in `update_env.yml`
