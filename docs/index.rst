Colmena: A Library for AI-Steered Simulation Campaigns
======================================================

Colmena is a library that supports applications which steer large campaigns
of simulations on supercomputers.
Such "high-throughput" searches are commonly deployed on HPC and are,
historically, guided by humans designating a search space manually
--- a time-consuming process.
Colmena was created to explore building applications high-throughput
sweeps that replace human steering with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
experimental design methods.

Why Colmena?
------------

Colmena is Spanish for "beehive."
Colmena applications, like their namesake,
feature independent agents that perform a variety
of tasks over their lifetimes without much of a need to
directly communicate with each other.
