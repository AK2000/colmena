# Random Search Application

This demo app is a minimal example of running an optimization problem: sequential random guesses.

The application starts two processes: a "Thinker" that proposes new simulations to run
and a "Doer" that manages running them.

## Running 

First launch a Redis server, then call `python random_search.py`.
