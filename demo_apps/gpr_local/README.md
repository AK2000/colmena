# Gaussian Process Optimization on Local Threads

This demo application demonstrates using Gaussian Process Optimization where the
GPR model is trained and evaluated locally.

The ``Thinker`` class in this example performs the GPR fitting and evaluation
and the ``Doer`` class evaluates the target function

## Running 

First launch a Redis server, then call `python gpr_local.py`.
