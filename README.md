Colmena is a library that supports applications which steer large campaigns of simulations on supercomputers.
Such "high-throughput" searches are commonly deployed on HPC and are, historically, 
guided by humans designating a search space manually &mdash; a time-consuming process.
Colmena was created to explore building applications high-throughput sweeps that replace human steering
with Artificial Intelligence (AI) experimental design methods. 

## Installation

We use Anaconda to define an environments:

``conda env create --file environment.yml --force``

will install all packages needed for the colmena library and demo applications.

Consult our [Installation Guide](https://colmena.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Using Colmena

We are gradually building ``demo_apps`` which illustrate different approaches to using the prototype.
